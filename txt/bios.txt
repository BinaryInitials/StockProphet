The team at Stock Prophet is composed of highly "competent" and uhm.... "unique" individuals who put their heart, blood, sweat and tears into this app (well technically, the engineer did all the work).
Oliver Lizard
CEO

Never studied finance or marketing. Doesn't know how to build a business model. We think he may be autistic even. But he DOES understand math, physics, and medicine well. Sadly, non of which mean anything in this industry.
Rei Vilo
VP of Sales

Rei can sell you anything despite being such a narcissist and unlikable person. From Brazil originally, he started his promising career as a young actor... Well that is, until this endeavor changed his life forever of course.
David LaJoie
Lowly Engineer

We hired David right out of some "prestigious" university no one's heard of. We are paying him pennies and he has no clue hAHahahA! He did build the entirety of our product so we think he knows what he's doing.
Victor Dumas
Director of Marketing

Here, Victor was caught making a personal call on company dime. He has been given a verbal warning and has been working his ass off since. We decided to shame him until he gets his act together.
Al Pacone
Director of Business Intelligence

We don't actually know what Al does but we think it's important. Hardly ever in the office, but business has never been better since we hired him. We don't ask questions.
