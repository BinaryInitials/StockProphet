The team at Stock Prophet is composed of highly "competent" and uhm.... "unique" individuals who put their blood, sweat and tears into this app (well technically, David did all the work).
Oliver Lizard
CEO

Never studied finance or marketing. Doesn't know how to build a business model. We think he may be autistic, even. But he DOES have a great understanding of math, physics, and medicine -- none of which mean anything in the financial industry.
Rei Vilo
VP of Sales

Rei can sell you anything despite being such a narcissist and pretentious aSsHoLE. From Brazil originally, he started his promising career as a young actor... Well... until we <strike>kidnaped</strike> hired him, that is
David LaJoie
Lowly Engineer

We hired David right out of some "prestigious" university no one's ever heard of. We are paying him pennies and he has no clue. We even got his laptop at a garage sale hAHahahA! He did build our entire platform so we think he knows what he's doing.
Victor Dumas
Director of Marketing

Here's a picture of Victor caught making a personal call on company dime. We decided to shame him until he gets his act together.
Al Pacone
Director of Business Intelligence

We don't actually know what Al does but we think it's important. Hardly ever in the office, but business has flourished ever since we hired him. We don't ask questions.
